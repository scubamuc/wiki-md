here are some of my personal notes and rough drafts for official [wikis](https://github.com/nextcloud-snap/nextcloud-snap/wiki). Some are in german, some have been translated in english and others are mixed.

Remember these are notes... so use any commands **at own risk**. Adapt them to your needs if you like, but be careful and double check!

If you find the information you need, thats great.
