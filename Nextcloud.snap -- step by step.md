# Your own Nextcloud snap

## 1. Usage and requirements
You have decided to set up your own Nextcloud snap as a safe and secure home for your data, **that's great!**

Before getting started be aware of what you expect from your Nextcloud instance and what requirements have to be met to fulfill your needs. 
Beside available/required hardware there are some other aspects to consider too like;
+ number of users
+ storage requirements
+ power efficiency
+ network connectivity
+ backup / redundancy
+ etc...

It will be necessary to do research. The onus is on you. Read the docs and wikis, do the basics, take notes and consider your options.
